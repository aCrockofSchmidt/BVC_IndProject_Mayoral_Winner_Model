The BVC Tech Initiative program has a group industry project component. The cohort I am in was tasked with creating a database that contains election results from the 2017 Calgary Municipal Election alongside the community demographics data compiled from public community profiles for each neighbourhood in the city. As a tangential curiosity, after our two weeks of IBM SPSS studies, I decided it might be fun to model the community data we had gathered and see if any of that data accurately predicted the most popular mayoral candidate in the 2017 election.

Some notes of interest. My model is very rudimentary.
We only had access to IBM SPSS software through a virtual machine linkup so I was unable to download anything beyond a screen grab of the stream I created.
My skills are novice level to say the least.
